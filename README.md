# face-detector
This site is live on [here](https://face-detector-e2hi.onrender.com/). Yay! When you go to this site it wants you to register.DON'T use your real name, DON'T use your real email, and I DON'T recomend using a password that you already used on a different site. Altough your password is protected by hash. Your name and email is not. so for those use something silly like: "Unnamed Person" and "i_love_patetos@burger.tomato"

Note: Your account will be deleted from my database at a maximum of 90 days after your account is created. This is because I use a free version of render.com

Note: A friend of mine hacked this website using CSRF attack. So I fixed that isue. Let's hope we are safe now ðŸ˜…
