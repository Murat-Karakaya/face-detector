This site is live on https://face-detector-e2hi.onrender.com/. Yay! When you go to this site it wants you to register.DON'T use your real name, DON'T use your real email, and I DON'T recomend using a password that you already used on a different site. Altough your password is protected by hash. Your name and email is not. so for those use something silly like: "Unnamed Person" and "i_love_patetos@burger.tomato"
