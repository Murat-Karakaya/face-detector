# Security Policy

When you go to this site it wants you to register.DON'T use your real name, DON'T use your real email, and I DON'T recomend using a password that you already used on a different site. So for your account name and email you can use something silly like: "Unnamed Person" and "i_love_patetos@burger.tomato"

I did my best to make this website pretty secure. But saddly I did not used any kind of captcha.
